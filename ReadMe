usage: conjunction.py [-h] [-x LONGITUDE] [-y LATITUDE] [-t TIMEZONE] [-e ELEVATION] [time] [date]

positional arguments:
  time                  Local time for calculation, default is current time, as HH:MM:SS.
  date                  Local date for calculation, default is current date, as YYYY-MM-DD.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -x LONGITUDE, --longitude LONGITUDE
                        East longitude of the observer in decimal degrees. West is negative.
  -y LATITUDE, --latitude LATITUDE
                        North latitude of the observer. South is negative.
  -t TIMEZONE, --timezone TIMEZONE
                        The local time-zone of the observer.
  -e ELEVATION, --elevation ELEVATION
                        Elevation in metres above sea level.

This script will compute the local coordinates (altitude and azimuth) for Jupiter and Saturn for the given date. Altitude is degrees above the horizon and
azimuth is degrees eastwards from North. Locate North by finding the Polaris, the pole star.
